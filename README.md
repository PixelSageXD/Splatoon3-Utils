# Pixel's Splatoon 3 Utils

A set of random utility programs made in separate Python files to make your Splatoon 3 experience just that little bit nicer!  
Every file is **fully commented** so you can see exactly how they all work, although you don't have to know it to be able to use it.  

## Programs

Currently there are only a few select programs that I've made, but feel free to let me know if you have any ideas!  
* **Set Maplist Generator:** A way to easily make maplists for competitive scrims or sets (made 19 Sep 2025)  
* **Big Run Egg Calculator:** A program that automatically calculates requirements and averages for Big Run medal quotas (made 20 Sep 2025)  

## How to Use

This part is really simple - just download the `SplatoonUtils.zip` folder from the latest release, extract it, and double click on the program you want to use.  
It should open in some sort of command prompt window and you will be able to do all the inputs and get the correct output.  
If there are formatting errors or it doesn't work, then download an IDE/code editor like IDLE or VSCode and run the files inside those.  

## Suggestions?

Let me know!! I just made these as a silly project but I'd love to continue updating them for all of the needs of the competitive and casual Splatoon communities :)  
You can DM me on Discord if you have any questions or suggestions (@pixlsage).

## Why not use existing methods?

Even if some of these exist in other forms on the web, I felt like a lot of those versions were missing features that I thought would have been useful, at least for when I was using them.  
And of course, some of them don't exist anywhere else (at least to my knowledge)!
